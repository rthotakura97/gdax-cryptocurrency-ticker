# gdax-cryptocurrency-ticker
An interactive cryptocurrency ticker that tracks and displays information about Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) data. Uses an unofficial GDAX API Python package that utilizes a REST API.   

## Setup (very easy!)
If you do not have "pip"installed, please install it first.
Then:
```
pip install gdax
```
Next, you need to get the repo onto your local system:
```
git clone https://github.com/rthotakura97/gdax-cryptocurrency-ticker.git
```
Travel to the directory you have the program and then execute using:
```
python main.py
```
That's it! Enjoy!
